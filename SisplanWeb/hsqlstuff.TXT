HSQL Set up
-----------
1) Download from http://hsqldb.org/
2) Unzip it into dir of choice (here on as {hsql-dir})
3) Copy hsqldb.jar from {hsql-dir}/hsqldb/lib and place copy in C:\{yourTomcatDir}\common\lib
4) Make directory in {hsql-dir}/hsqldb called "mydb"
5) Copy the mydb.script from the root of rr-ibatis and place this script in the hsql-dir/hsqldb/mydb dir.
6) From cmd line move to the mydb dir ({hsql-dir}/hsqldb/mydb) and run the following:

   java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 mydb -dbname.0 xdb

   *You will need to always have the server started by doing the above in order for the local app we are building to run
7) When you want to kill that server just press ctrl-c from the window where its running
